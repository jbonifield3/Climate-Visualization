## How to work with the LATEX Files
First two pieces of sofware are needed on your local machine:
1) A LaTeX compiler such as MikText (https://miktex.org/)
2) A LaTeX Editor such as TexStudio (https://www.texstudio.org/)

## Order of Installation
It is best to install MikText completely; run it and let it finish the setup and then install TexStudio.

## Compiling the ACM style
Open "acmart.ins" from the acmart-master directory in TextStudio and click the single green play button to compile.  Click "Ok" for the pop-up window.  You can close the acmart.ins file out of the editor it will not be needed anymore.

Now in TexStudio open the "cse6242_project_proposal_bulleted.tex" and click the double green play button to create the PDF.  If successfull after a few seconds the rendered document should show up on the right.

## Learning LaTeX
It can be a bigger learnin curve to learn then most WYSIWYG editors but it is extremely powerful and throughout the OMSCS program there are definitely benefits to being able to use it effectively.
